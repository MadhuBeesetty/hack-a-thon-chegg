It is meant to help students in high school and college. It also owns citation services EasyBib, Citation Machine, BibMe, and Cite This For Me. The company was created in the United States by three Iowa State University students in 2001 and was founded by entrepreneur Aayush Phumbhra.[2] The name Chegg is a portmanteau of the words chicken and egg, based on the founders experience after graduating from college; they could not land a job without experience, but could not get experience without a job.[3]' },
